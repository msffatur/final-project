# final-project

Here is my final project about *SPEED CONTROL DESIGN OF THE AUTOMATED PEOPLE MOVER SYSTEM TRAIN USING PID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION PARALLELED WITH FUZZY LOGIC SUGENO FOR SPEED AND POSITION TARGET TO NUMBER OF PASSENGERS VARIATIONS*. In this research, there were three parts of control simulation, PID auto tuning as a comparison, PID PSO, and PID PSO paralleled with Fuzzy Logic Sugeno. Simulation was carried out by five variations of the train mass based on the number of passengers to compare the performance of each controller in handling the variation of condition caused by the uncertainty of number of passengers.
